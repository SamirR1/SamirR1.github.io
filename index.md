**Professional Self-Assessment**
Being a part of the computer science program at SNHU over the last three years has culminated into this capstone that will be presented here. This capstone and the artifacts within it showcase the skills I have gained throughout this program and the importance of perseverance to push through the hard times and those difficult classes that cause you to put in those extra hours studying. This program has taught me to research and read documentation of code. Failing at something is good as long as you learn from those failures and use them to push yourself further in the future. This capstone and the artifacts within it were failures but were used to improve my skills in software that I was unfamiliar with. MySQL was something I had only used in one class before and throughout the computer science program this software was already configured for you to use. Learning to configure and write code for MySQL was a challenge that made me want to quit and start with another program for the capstone but I knew I could do it and I would be happy if I did stick with it. The first and second artifact were from CS410 which was originally created from reverse engineering a program but I decided to convert it from C++ to python. Then to add more features to it. For the software design portion of the assignment I laid out a plan to convert the program and add more features for division. The next artifact was used to showcase my strengths in data structures by allowing the user to input more than two numbers and give the user the choice of arithmetic to use. Also adding security features of a username and password that are required and then encoding and decoding that information.
This degree has prepared me to enter this new career field as a software engineer by exposing me to multiple types of programming languages and ideas, testing me at times to learn new concepts quickly and switch between visual programming and graphics to mobile applications and databases. Collaborating in a team environment through GitHub helped to figure out what to do if a coworker has erased something you worked on and requires merging saves from multiple people. Throughout the capstone security and teams were in mind by commenting continuously for another programmer to be able to review the code and understand what is going on and mitigating security risks by blocking input types and bounds of input.
