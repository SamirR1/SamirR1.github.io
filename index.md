**Professional Self-Assessment**
Being a part of the computer science program at SNHU over the last three years has culminated into this capstone that will be presented here. This capstone and the artifacts within it showcase the skills I have gained throughout this program and the importance of perseverance to push through the hard times and those difficult classes that cause you to put in those extra hours studying. This program has taught me to research and read documentation of code. Failing at something is good as long as you learn from those failures and use them to push yourself further in the future. This capstone and the artifacts within it were failures but were used to improve my skills in software that I was unfamiliar with. MySQL was something I had only used in one class before and throughout the computer science program this software was already configured for you to use. Learning to configure and write code for MySQL was a challenge that made me want to quit and start with another program for the capstone but I knew I could do it and I would be happy if I did stick with it. The first and second artifact were from CS410 which was originally created from reverse engineering a program but I decided to convert it from C++ to python. Then to add more features to it. For the software design portion of the assignment I laid out a plan to convert the program and add more features for division. The next artifact was used to showcase my strengths in data structures by allowing the user to input more than two numbers and give the user the choice of arithmetic to use. Also adding security features of a username and password that are required and then encoding and decoding that information.
This degree has prepared me to enter this new career field as a software engineer by exposing me to multiple types of programming languages and ideas, testing me at times to learn new concepts quickly and switch between visual programming and graphics to mobile applications and databases. Collaborating in a team environment through GitHub helped to figure out what to do if a coworker has erased something you worked on and requires merging saves from multiple people. Throughout the capstone security and teams were in mind by commenting continuously for another programmer to be able to review the code and understand what is going on and mitigating security risks by blocking input types and bounds of input.

**Artifact 1 and 2 Narrative:**

The artifact that was used for this milestone was a project from CS410 that was originally created in C++. This project was reverse engineered and found to be a calculator that only accepted two numbers and performed addition, subtraction, division only. This artifact is also used as the second artifact.

This artifact was selected for the first and second artifact because I felt like there was a lot that could be added to this project and it wouldn’t be too difficult to create a program that could be added to further and could be created to be much more complex. The artifact showcases my skills in understanding multiple programming languages, documenting in comments anything that could be confused by someone reviewing the code as well as the different functions that were used for python and the functions developed for multiplication and division features and use of an array to allow the user to input more numbers. The aspects that showcase skills in data structures and algorithms is the creation of an array to hold all of the inputs from the user that will allow the program to do more calculations than just two numbers. Showcasing skills with algorithms was a little more difficult but the use of encoding a username and password then decoding as well as the use of two new functions that were created to multiply and divide numbers if those options were selected without being interrupted by numbers that are not integers or zeros. The artifact was improved by allowing the user to input more than two inputs. An additional option for multiplication, and the addition of a username and password check.

As I was creating and improving this artifact it was difficult creating the new functions and not zeroing out the sum with having zero be the input that would stop taking inputs from the user and would then return the total back to them. I learned from this process to think in simpler terms of how the math would perform normally that dividing and multiplying by zero would throw off the calculation completely. The main challenge was working to become more familiar with the base64 option in python to encode/decode.

**Artifact 3 Narrative:**

The artifact that was used for this milestone was a project from CS340. This artifact was a mongoDB database but for this milestone I was unable to properly configure mongoDB on my computer so I decided to work with MySQL instead. This is a simple usage of a database but the more difficult part was configuring the database then to actually create the program that allows users to input information, read information and delete information from the database. 

This artifact is included in my ePortfolio because databases are an important concept to show a familiarity in. Databases are used in everything and have been common to use a cloud based database in recent years. I selected this item because I thought it would be good to show and work with a database even if it would be difficult to setup and configure a database on my own computer compared to the virtual machines that SNHU had given us to work with in the past. Once the database was configured properly it became easier to focus efforts on just the programming itself. The specific components that showcase skills and abilities is the simple approach to allow inputs from the user to add to the database and to read the database. The deletion feature could be more complex adding a feature to delete select entries only instead of deleting everything. The artifact wasn’t really improved from the past but it shows an understanding of MySQL and databases to work with databases.

Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact I learned to configure my own machine and to relearn MySQL for creating your own input options instead of in the past using MySQL at SNHU we only read and pulled data. The biggest challenge was the time to download the MySQL software.
